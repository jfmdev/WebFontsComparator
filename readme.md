Web Fonts Comparator
====================

**Web Font Comparator** is a simple tool for compare web fonts
(in particular, the fonts that are considered [safe for web use](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp)).

It's useful for identify unknowns fonts in images or pictures, 
or when you find which is the safe font most similar to a non-safe font.
